I'm Mark currenly working as a Data Analyst and for me coding is quite a puzzle where pattern is a key to determine how to solve to puzzle 
I love playing Dota during my free time,engaging myself to physical activities making sure I had the good fit condition by going to the gym regularly 
Most likely if I do not mingle with other peers mybe I'm an introvert I find myself more peaceful whenever I do some task alone 
Yeah that's me tryin to be the best version of myself
